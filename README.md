# .NET Classroom Template

Template for autograding enabled .NET projects in GitHub Classroom.

## Quickstart

Use this template as a baseline for defining your Classroom assignments. DO NOT use the Classroom GUI to add autograding tests &ndash; edit `.github/classroom/GenerateAutograding/Tests.cs` instead.

See PRs [#3 Correct implementation](https://github.com/V0ldek/ClassroomTemplate/pull/3) and [#4 Incorrect implementation](https://github.com/V0ldek/ClassroomTemplate/pull/4) to see the autograding in action.

## Implementation notes

There are three facts that you need to know to understand the workarounds here.

1. By default, the GitHub Classroom pipeline doesn't setup .NET with the `actions/setup-dotnet@v1` action and thus doesn't work for .NET 6 projects.
2. Adding or editing any tests in GitHub Classroom assignment edit page **Grading and feedback/Add autograding tests** sections overwrites the `.github/workflows` directory and the pipeline defined within.
3. When the `education/autograding@v1` action runs the defined command (e.g. `dotnet run` or `dotnet test`) it sandboxes it in an environment where only the `PATH` variable is set. .NET requires the `HOME` or `DOTNET_CLI_HOME` environment variables to point to the user's home directory to work correctly.

Because of point 1. a custom pipeline is required. Because of 2., setting up autograding tests has to be done by manually updating `.github/classroom/autograding.json`. Finally, because of 3., when updating the tests it is important to prefix every command ran with an explicit overwrite of the `DOTNET_CLI_HOME` for .NET to work properly in the sandbox.

## Example `autograding.json`

An example `autograding.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "Console Test (ClassroomTemplate)",
      "setup": "",
      "run": "DOTNET_CLI_HOME=/home/runner dotnet run --project ClassroomTemplate",
      "input": "",
      "output": "Hello, World!",
      "comparison": "exact",
      "timeout": 1,
      "points": 50
    },
    {
      "name": "Unit Tests (Adder)",
      "setup": "",
      "run": "DOTNET_CLI_HOME=/home/runner dotnet test --filter TestGroup=Adder",
      "input": "",
      "output": "",
      "comparison": "included",
      "timeout": 1,
      "points": 25
    },
    {
      "name": "Unit Tests (HelloWorld)",
      "setup": "",
      "run": "DOTNET_CLI_HOME=/home/runner dotnet test --filter TestGroup=HelloWorld",
      "input": "",
      "output": "",
      "comparison": "included",
      "timeout": 1,
      "points": 25
    }
  ]
}
```

For my purposes, I cannot think of any other reasonable tests than "run the program and see its output" or "run the unit tests". To enable dividing tests into groups and scoring them independently, I use a filter on the `TraitAttribute` of `xUnit`. So in this case we have a test method for `HelloWorld` marked with
```csharp
[Trait("TestGroup", "HelloWorld")]
```
and for `Adder` marked with
```csharp
[Trait("TestGroup", "Adder")]
```

You can produce such a JSON by hand and put it into the `.github/classroom` directory.

## Automating the automation

I really hate typing, especially typing JSONs. Therefore, included here is a small utility that can generate such JSON files with a simple object model in C#. Only thing one needs to do is edit the `.github/classroom/GenerateAutograding/Tests.cs` file and implement the `Tests` property. Here's the definition of the above example JSON:

```csharp
public IReadOnlyList<Test> Tests => new Test[]
{
    new InputOutputTest(_startupProject, "", "Hello, World!")
    {
        Points = 50
    },
    new DotnetTestGroup("Adder")
    {
        Points = 25
    },
    new DotnetTestGroup("HelloWorld")
    {
        Points = 25
    },
};
```

By default all tests are given `1` point and `1` minute timeout, determined by `Points` and `Timeout` properties. This utility is then invoked in the GitHub action, like so:
```
dotnet run --project ./.github/classroom/GenerateAutograding -- -e ClassroomTemplate -p 100 -o ./.github/classroom/autograding.json
```

You can change the `-e` and `-p` arguments to suit your needs. Here's the usage:

```
GenerateAutograding 1.0.0
Copyright (C) 2022 V0ldek

  -e, --entry-project    Required. Name of the project that provides input/output for use with `dotnet run`.

  -o, --output           Required. Full path to the output JSON file. The directory path must exist.

  -p, --points           Total number of points from all tests. If provided, the program will validate that the defined tests' points sum to this value.

  --help                 Display this help screen.

  --version              Display version information.
```

## License

Everything here is licensed under the MIT license. The example code (`ClassroomTemplate` and `ClassroomTemplate.Tests` projects) is completely replaceable so you can license your assignment under anything you would like (the "substantial parts of this software" doesn't really apply to "Hello World"). However, if you reuse the pipeline and `GenerateAutograding`, keep it under MIT.
